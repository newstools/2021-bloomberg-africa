Boris Johnson’s education czar who was tasked with helping children recover from lost schooling due to the coronavirus pandemic has resigned, denouncing the government’s plan due to a lack of resources. Kevan Collins, who was appointed by Johnson in February, said the 1.4 billion-pound ($2 billion) package for extra tutoring and training for teachers would not be enough to rectify the lost learning, according to a statement reported by TES. Collins’s resignation is a blow to Johnson and casts doubt over his efforts to repair the social damage and worsening inequalities created by the pandemic. It also comes as Johnson weighs whether to go ahead with a final easing of coronavirus restrictions June 21, amid signs of a potential fresh wave of the disease. “I do not believe it is credible that a successful recovery can be achieved with a programme of support of this size,” Collins said in his statement. “I hope you are able to allocate the additional resources that are likely to be needed.” The government’s education catch-up plan announced Wednesday included 1 billion pounds for a “national tutoring revolution,” which would fund 6 million, 15-hour tutoring courses for the most disadvantaged pupils and more tuition for 16-19 year-olds. It also included 400 million pounds for training teachers and early years staff. 10 Downing Street said Johnson is grateful for Collins’s work in helping pupils catch up and recover from the effects of the pandemic. “The government will continue to focus on education recovery and making sure no child is left behind with their learning,” a Downing Street spokesperson said. Schools in England reopened in March after a two-month closure during the third national lockdown. Virus restrictions meant most pupils only had one full term of classroom-based lessons since coronvairus hit the U.K. in early 2020. — With assistance by Emily Ashton
