U.S. equity futures rose modestly with European stocks on Wednesday as the tussle between economic optimism and inflation concern continued to play out in markets. The dollar ticked up. Contracts on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 gauges drifted higher as traders awaited fresh catalysts in economic data, including U.S. payrolls, due later this week. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. extended gains in pre-market trading after earlier raising $230.5 million in a stock sale to Mudrick Capital Management. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.2%, with energy shares getting a boost from oil prices. Crude extended gains after closing at the highest since October 2018, with OPEC+ providing an upbeat demand assessment and the prospect of a speedy return of Iranian barrels waning. Treasuries were little changed. As economies continue to claw their way back from the pandemic, traders are looking for fresh signals on whether that growth translates into inflation that ultimately prompts central banks to withdraw support. Up next is Friday’s U.S. payrolls data, which will provide a clearer view of the state of the labor market -- and hints on whether the Federal Reserve is likely to scale back its monthly asset purchases. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said on Tuesday there are risks on both sides of monetary policy as the U.S. economy surges ahead while millions of people are unemployed. “Investors would see a surge in payrolls growth as a sign that the Fed is more likely to move,” said Lauren Goodwin, portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments. Elsewhere, shares in Hong Kong and China retreated, while Japanese stocks outperformed and robust economic figures boosted Australian equities. The Turkish lira fell to a record low against the greenback after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan renewed calls for lower interest rates.
