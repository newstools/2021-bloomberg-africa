Right-wing organizers of the deadly 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, asked a judge to move the upcoming trial of victims’ civil lawsuit against them to another city out of fear that violent protesters will attack them with impunity.

Her clients seek unspecified financial damages for emotional distress and other injuries, as well as judgments that the organizers conspired to incite a riot and violently harass protesters based on racial, religious and ethnic animosity.
