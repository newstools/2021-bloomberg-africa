By one measure, at least, there was a bright spot in 2020 for people able to save in workplace retirement plans like 401(k)s. They watched their account balances rise, on average, 21% during the year, thanks in large part to stock-market gains, according to Vanguard’s annual How America Saves report released Thursday. Most people don’t actively make trades or even change the mix of investments in these kinds of accounts. Many use funds that plan for a target retirement year and which automatically change the mix of investments over time. But not everyone left their plan on autopilot. Some 10% of savers moved money between different fund options in their plan in 2020, up from 7% in 2019. The report didn’t say which group of people had better returns. Emergency pandemic legislation made it easier for some people to  withdraw up to $100,000 penalty-free from their accounts last year. Some worried that this would derail retirement savings for those who took advantage of the relaxed access. Vanguard found that about 5.7% of people whose plans allowed the emergency Covid withdrawals took advantage of it, and they withdrew an average of about 40% of the account balance. The overall good news in Vanguard’s report overshadows the fact that people with lower incomes can’t necessarily afford to put money aside in plans like 401(k)s. Among those who have access to a workplace retirement-savings plan and make less than $15,000, 37% took part in the plan in 2020. Participation rates rise with income, and nearly all people who make $150,000 or more put money into their workplace retirement-savings accounts. People working in wholesale and retail had the lowest participation rate, at 61%, and workers in finance, insurance and real estate had the highest, at 90%.
