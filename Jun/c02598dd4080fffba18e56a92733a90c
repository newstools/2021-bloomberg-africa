MTN Group Ltd., which has the second-most subscribers in the country, and Telkom SA SOC Ltd. have appealed to the courts about how the regulator is arranging the auction, which was announced in October after years of delays and is expected to raise more than 8 billion rand ($583 million). The legal action prompted President Cyril Ramaphosa to hit out at mobile-phone companies last week, urging them to resolve the matter for the benefit of the country.

South African market leader Vodacom Group Ltd., which hasn’t objected to the process, and MTN have long called for a wider spectrum to expand their data services and boost revenue. The government sees the move as a way to attract investment and help revive a moribund economy. Both sides say the plan will bring down prices, which have led to regulator censure and protests from users.
