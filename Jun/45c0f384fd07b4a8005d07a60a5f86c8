Wall Street regulators delivered a uniform message to President Joe Biden Monday: the huge capital buffers that banks built up over the pandemic are protecting the financial system from looming threats. In a meeting at the White House, the heads of the Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies told Biden that the financial system is doing well, according to a statement released by the administration. Among topics discussed were how to continue the economic recovery and extend credit to underserved communities. “The regulators reported that the financial system is in strong condition,” the White House said. “They further indicated that financial risks are being mitigated by robust capital and liquidity levels in the banking system, and healthy household balance sheets stemming from fiscal support and the ongoing economic recovery.” LISTEN: Brian Morgenstern, Senior Advisor at the America First Policy Institute discusses President Biden’s meeting.
