The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority said an application by Sinovac Biotech Ltd. to have its Coronavac Covid-19 vaccine approved “is at a very advanced stage.” So far South Africa has only approved the Pfizer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for use. Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine is also being evaluated. The regulator commented in a statement on Monday.
