Paul Tudor Jones said economic orthodoxy has been turned upside down with the Federal Reserve focused on unemployment even as inflation and financial stability are growing concerns. Inflation risk isn’t transitory, the hedge fund manager said in an interview on CNBC. If the Fed says the U.S. economy is on the right path, “then I would go all in on the inflation trade, buy commodities, crypto and gold,” he said. “If they course correct, you will get a taper tantrum and a sell off in fixed income and a correction in stocks. Jones said if he was on the investment committee of a pension fund, he would “have as many inflation hedges on as I possibly could.” The next Fed meeting is June 16. Among his other comments: "I think this Fed meeting could be the most important Fed meeting in Jay Powell's career," says billionaire and legendary trader @ptj_official. pic.twitter.com/M3NlJB94zV Story Link: Paul Tudor Jones Tells CNBC Things Are ‘Bat S Crazy’ Right Now
