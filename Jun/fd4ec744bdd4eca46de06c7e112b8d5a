Ugandaâ€™s government ordered schools and places of worship closed, and restricted public transport between regions, for six weeks to contain a fresh flood of Covid-19 infections. Public gatherings -- excluding cabinet, legislative and judiciary sittings -- have also been banned, President Yoweri Museveni said Sunday night in a televised address from the capital, Kampala. Infection rates in the East African country, which first imposed a lockdown from March to September 2020, have climbed 26% since the start of May to 52,935 cases by Sunday, while deaths have risen about 12% to 383 during the period, according the Ministry of Health.
