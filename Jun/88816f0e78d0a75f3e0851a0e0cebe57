The prevalence of Covid-19 in England is increasing exponentially, driven by younger age groups that haven’t been vaccinated, according to the latest round of results from the React-1 study. The research, led by Imperial College London, shows the national prevalence of the virus has increased by 50% in its latest round of analysis recorded between May 20 and June 7, compared with its last round from April 15 to May 3. A doubling time of around every 11 days was now estimated, with the R number at 1.44, the report said. It also found a re-convergence between prevalence and the pattern of hospitalizations and deaths since late April for those under 65. This is consistent with the Delta variant now dominating across the country, researchers said in a media briefing. They added that the government’s plan to mass vaccinate younger age groups should slow growth. NHS England said yesterday that adults between 21 and 22 years old are now being offered the vaccine, and all who are 18 and older will be eligible by the end of this week. Virus data released by the U.K. government yesterday shows that people testing positive rose 31.8% in the last seven days. However, deaths are still low and around 79.8% of the population has received a first dose of the vaccine, while 57.8% has now had a second jab.
