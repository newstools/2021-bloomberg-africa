Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission has banned digital asset exchanges from trading meme- or fan-based tokens, non-fungible tokens and exchange-issued tokens. The regulation, which is expected to affect tokens like Dogecoin as well as tokenized arts and collectibles, was enacted Friday with immediate effect, although it’s not retroactive, according to a statement from the regulator. Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol, the regulator’s secretary-general, said the exchanges are banned from trading utility tokens or cryptocurrencies that have one or any of the following characteristics: The exchanges are required to comply and revise their rules within 30 days, the regulator said. Failure to do so could result in the delisting of the digital token, it said.
