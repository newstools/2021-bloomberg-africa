McDonald’s Corp. defeated a lawsuit accusing it of discriminating against the Black franchise operators of four of its Tennessee restaurants by pushing them to operate in crime-ridden neighborhoods. U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber ruled on Tuesday that the suit, filed in October, lacked facts showing McDonald’s misled the franchisees in their contracts and treated White franchisees differently. Leinenweber gave the plaintiffs an option to file an amended complaint that address the inadequacies he pointed out within 30 days. “The court does not mean to imply that McDonald’s operations over the years have not been tainted by the brush of racism,” Leinenweber said in the ruling. “The fact that the first African-American franchisees didn’t appear until 15 years after the franchise system was established in 1955 provides the opposite inference. However, historical discrimination cannot be the base for a Section 1981 discrimination suit filed in 2020.” The judge was referring to part of a federal law that allows people to sue for racial discrimination they face in making and enforcing contracts.
