Goldman Sachs Asset Management and a unit of South Africa’s Discovery Ltd. have tailored an investment offering to profit from trends such as the spending habits of millennials and advances in health care. Discovery’s Global Megatrends Fund allows clients in South Africa to allocate investments equally across four of Goldman’s equity portfolios linked to the themes of technology, health care, environmental sustainability and a younger generation of consumers. Customers will have access to the global artificial intelligence market, expected to grow to $190 billion by 2025, and companies catering to the world’s 2.3 billion millennials, according to a statement on Monday.

The fund caters to South African clients with a higher risk appetite and also seeking access to markets and sectors unavailable at home. Most of its asset base is located in North America while spanning other regions including Europe and Asia.

The firm, started in 2007, has about 114 billion rand ($8 billion) in assets under management, according to Discovery Invest Chief Executive Officer Kenny Rabson. Portfolio diversification is at the heart of the fund’s appeal for local clients, according to Discovery and Goldman, since South African stocks represent less than 1% of the global equity market. “In this fund you have the full force of these megatrends but you have diversified the risk by owning all four of them,” Wiseman said. “It’s about ultimately being on the right side of long-term, secular growth.”
