The U.K.’s top financiers have been invited to meet Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak to discuss the country’s post-pandemic recovery. Executives from companies including Standard Chartered Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc and London Stock Exchange Group Plc are expected to attend a virtual meeting Monday, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing private matters. The industry’s role in aiding the U.K. economy will be discussed along with areas such as fintech and green finance, according to Sky News, which reported the plan earlier and said bosses from firms such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc and insurer Aviva Plc are also expected to attend. The meeting comes as the City of London seeks to maintain its attractiveness as a global financial center after Brexit. The European Union is looking to win back some of the business that gravitated toward the Square Mile over the past few decades, while the U.K. finance industry is trying to hold this ground as well as grow international business.
