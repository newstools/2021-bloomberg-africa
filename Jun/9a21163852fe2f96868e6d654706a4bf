Lufthansa Consulting GmbH is in talks with Sudan’s government over a role in restructuring one of Africa’s oldest airlines. “If not through a joint venture, they can help to restructure Sudan Airways so that it can be competitive,” Finance Minister Gibril Ibrahim said in an interview. He didn’t give more details or say at what stage the discussions were. A delegation from Lufthansa Consulting, an independent subsidiary of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, will travel to Khartoum, the African nation’s capital, in June to continue talks with Sudanese authorities, a representative for the company said in an emailed response to questions. Founded in 1946, Sudan Airways stands to benefit from the country’s reintegration with the global economy after the end of U.S. restrictions. In 2018, it was facing sweeping staff cuts as well as difficulties in maintaining its fleet, forcing it to lease planes from other airlines. — With assistance by Layan Odeh
