U.S. equity futures and stocks posted modest gains Monday as investors prepared for a key Federal Reserve meeting later in the week. The rally in Treasuries appeared to lose steam. S&P 500 futures signaled the gauge was poised to add to Friday’s fresh record. European equities opened higher, led by shares in energy firms. The benchmark 10-year yield inched up to around 1.46% after hitting three-month lows on Thursday amid the biggest weekly slide since December. With anxiety about the Fed’s plans to scale back monthly stimulus injections ebbing, bulls are reasserting their dominance. Investors anticipate the central bank will reaffirm the pace of bond purchases this week, even if it delivers projections for interest-rate liftoff in 2023, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The decision is due Wednesday. “The FOMC continues to see the jump in inflation as transitory, and may acknowledge, even at the margin, that they are discussing the pace of monthly purchases but won’t yet commit to a date for slowing the purchases,” said Prudential Financial Inc. strategist Quincy Krosby in emailed comments. Oil extended a run of three weekly gains on optimism that economic reopenings will boost summer demand in the U.S. and Europe. Hedge funds boosted net-bullish positions to a nearly three-year high, according to the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. The dollar was steady in the wake of a Group-of-Seven leadership meeting that emphasized unity. Meanwhile, Bitcoin jumped over the weekend after Elon Musk said Tesla would resume transactions with the cryptocurrency when mining it is done with more clean energy.
