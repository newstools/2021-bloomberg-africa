The opposition party is set to finish with 21.5% of the vote, more than it had in the previous municipal vote four years ago. Prime Minister Sanna Marin’s Social Democrats are second ahead of Finance Minister Annika Saarikko’s Center Party after about 80% the ballots were counted. The populist Finns Party is in fourth place.

It’s also the first election into which Marin, 35, steered her party as leader. The vote was moved from mid-April to June to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The National Coalition had topped the polls ahead of the vote, with the Finns Party close behind. The turnout was about 55%, the lowest since the 1940s.
