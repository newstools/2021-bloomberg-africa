Hong Kong has started a project to explore issuing a digital currency that is anticipated to last over the next 12 months. “This is essentially a research study similar to what is being undertaken by many other jurisdictions,” the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Tuesday. It remains open minded and hopes to offer “initial thoughts” in 12 months, it said. The study will look at consumer needs, data privacy, anti-money laundering requirements, and other legal and policy considerations, the authority said. At the same time, it has also started a concept study along with BIS Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre to look at the potential for a retail level digital currency in the city.
