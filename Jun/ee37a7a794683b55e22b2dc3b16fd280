U.S. airports, roads and public transportation are crumbling, and fixes typically get made in only the most dire circumstances. Meanwhile, countries in Europe, Asia and the Middle East have leapt ahead with so-called smart cities, high-speed trains and eco-friendly buildings. In 2019, the U.S. ranked 13th in the world in a broad measure of infrastructure quality — down from fifth place in 2002, according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report. Will this be the moment the U.S. chooses to invest? American cities and states have rebounded from the pandemic faster than anticipated and are experiencing a double windfall of tax revenue and federal rescue aid that could allow for spending on everything from transit and housing to child care and broadband Internet access. Additionally, President Joe Biden is   proposing $1.7 trillion in spending that aims to create jobs, rein in climate change and make cities more equitable and livable for all residents. With this momentum building, Bloomberg CityLab is reporting on a range of projects across the country that have the potential to transform the communities they serve, and beyond.
