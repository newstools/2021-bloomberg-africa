Lara Trump, a daughter-in-law of former President Donald Trump, said Saturday she wouldn’t run for the open U.S. Senate seat in her home state of North Carolina in 2022. Trump had been considering a campaign for the seat being vacated by retiring Senator Richard Burr. The former president was in the middle of an address to the North Carolina Republican Party in Greenville when he invited the wife of his son, Eric, onto the stage. Lara Trump cited her two children, ages 1 and 3, in what she said was a difficult decision not to run. “No for now, not forever,” she said. Her father-in-law then endorsed U.S. Representative Ted Budd for the Republican primary. Other Republicans running include former Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory and former U.S. Representative Mark Walker.
