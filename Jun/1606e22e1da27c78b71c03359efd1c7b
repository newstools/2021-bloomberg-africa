The staggering surge in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. as a result of Reddit fans’ frenzy is making professional market participants increasingly uneasy. After retail traders sent the shares of the unprofitable movie-theater chain to a record high, bringing this year’s advance to almost 3,000%, investors and strategists are warning that the chances of getting badly burned and losing money on this trade are now very high. “The Reddit bandwagon will find new targets and revenge against short sellers is highly likely to continue,” Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said by email. “This has turned into a game, so investors who don’t have money they can afford to lose should stay clear of hot stocks. If lots of people are piling into a company, they are probably buying it at an inflated price, and as we’ve seen, rapid spikes in prices are often followed by equally rapid falls.” On Thursday, the Reddit-fueled rally showed no signs it’s running out of steam. AMC gained 18% in premarket trading to $73.80 as of 6:11 a.m. in New York.
