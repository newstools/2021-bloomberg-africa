Several Latin Americans, some who reportedly traveled to get vaccinated, are among the missing after an apartment building collapsed in the Miami area earlier this week. Nine Argentines, six Paraguayans and six Venezuelans were in the Champlain Towers in Surfside, Fla., according to the foreign ministries of their countries. Colombia reported missing citizens without providing an official figure. The Miami Herald said on Friday that at least 36 Latin Americans, including from Chile, Cuba and Puerto Rico, are among the missing, and that some had traveled to the U.S. to receive vaccines. People from across Latin America have traveled to the U.S., especially Miami, seeking Covid-19 shots as their countries struggle to ramp up vaccination campaigns while the pandemic takes a huge toll. Latin America accounts for about a third of the world’s coronavirus deaths, yet only 8% of the global population.
