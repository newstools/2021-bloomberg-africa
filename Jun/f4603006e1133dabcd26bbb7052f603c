Deutsche Bank AG’s female employees in the U.S. represent about 21% of the firm’s top ranks and Black people account for around 5%, according to data released by the bank for the first time Friday. For the U.S. as a whole, 37% of staff are women and 8% are Black. There were no Asian or Latinx employees among senior and executive leadership, even though Asian people represent almost 28% of the German bank’s workforce and Latinx people account for a little more than 9%. Less than a 10th of 1% of the bank’s U.S. workforce identified as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and the same was true for Native Americans and Alaskan Natives. Deutsche Bank plans to publish the numbers -- a summary of figures it provides annually to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission -- every year, it said in a statement.

That includes increasing the share of women in managing director, director and vice president roles to 35% by 2025, according to the statement.
