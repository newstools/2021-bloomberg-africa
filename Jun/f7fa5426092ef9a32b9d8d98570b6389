In case you’ve missed it, the price of  lumber has been plunging lately.  Since the frenzied peak in May, it’s now down more than 45%. Last week I caught up with lumber trader Stinson Dean (a former “Odd Lots” guest) to get his take on what’s goin on. In his view, the big story is the regaining of market power by homebuilders against the sawmills. He noted that you’re starting to see a normalization in the futures market. There’s not as much of a scramble for immediate delivery, so the premium for front-month futures is compressing relative to the second month. With the new-home market cooling down a little bit, he argues that builders are starting to have some leverage over the mills, which he says are “vulnerable for the first time” in this cycle. He adds that “the folks on the buyside seem way more comfortable waiting it out.” Again, that’s the type of thing reflected in the curve flattening, with less of a mad dash to get wood right now than there was for much of the year. There’s also an interesting market structure angle to the housing and lumber story. According to Dean, the building-materials players (companies that supply things like windows and garage doors) have been consolidating and tightening their terms to the homebuilders. This has, in turn, made the builders less comfortable taking price risk onto their own balance sheet, and as such that’s prompted them to draw a harder bargain against the mills, which helps explain the recent price weakness. Although prices are still elevated compared with the beginning of the year and last year, “supply is ample” and the short-covering phase of the market is gone.
