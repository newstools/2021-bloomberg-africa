Bitcoin slid after a cryptic tweet from Elon Musk hinting at a potential split with the largest cryptocurrency, the latest post from the billionaire to buffet the token’s price. The coin dropped as much as 2.8% and was trading at about $37,850 as of 9:20 a.m. in Hong Kong. The decline dented a stabilization in the largest virtual currency and the crypto sector in general this week after a rout in May. #Bitcoin  pic.twitter.com/lNnEfMdtJf In his latest tweet, Musk wrote “#Bitcoin” with a broken heart emoji. The tycoon has roiled Bitcoin prices with his social media messages, including a decision to suspend payments using the token to Tesla Inc. over environmental concerns.
