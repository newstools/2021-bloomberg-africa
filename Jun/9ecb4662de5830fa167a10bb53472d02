The so-called Steel and Metal Fabrication Master Plan agreed by the government and stakeholders in the industry that contributes 600 billion rand ($43.7 billion) to gross domestic product “provides a blueprint for the industry to re-energize itself and expand production,” the department said Sunday in a statement posted on its website.
