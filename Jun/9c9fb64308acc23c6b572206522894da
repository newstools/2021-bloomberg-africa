Some Apple Inc workers are resisting a call by management for them to return to the office for three days a week from early September, The Verge reported, citing a letter from the staff. Employees called for a flexible approach that allows them to work remotely, the news service said, citing the letter from about 80 of the workers. The note was sent to Apple staff for signing on late Friday, according to the report. Apple’s “remote/location-flexible work policy, and the communication around it,” has already led to some resignations, The Verge cited the letter as saying. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the news service. NOTE: Apple’s CEO Sets September Return to Offices in Flexible Setup
