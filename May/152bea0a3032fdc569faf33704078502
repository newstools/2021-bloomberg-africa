The bidding stands at $2.2 million and counting for a seat on a spaceflight by Jeff Bezos’s rocket company. More than 5,200 bidders from 136 countries have vied to ride on the July 20 flight of Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket, its first carrying people, the company said Wednesday. The top bid was $1.4 million after two weeks of sealed offers. The value surged when Blue Origin began displaying the bidding on its website ahead of a live auction June 12 to determine the winner. The rocket maker, which among other goals is trying to help pioneer space tourism, said May 5 that it has collected enough data to be ready for operational service after 15 test flights and 16 capsule landings at its West Texas launch site. The trips, each roughly 11 minutes in duration, will take riders above 100 kilometers (62 miles) into suborbital space. Blue Origin has declined to say how many people will fly on the company’s initial foray with humans, or whether they’ll be employees or customers. The Kent, Washington-based company has yet to unveil its standard ticket prices for future rides. The auction proceeds will go to Blue Origin’s foundation, which seeks to promote science, technical and math education.
