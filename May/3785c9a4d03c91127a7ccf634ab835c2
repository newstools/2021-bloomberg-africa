Meme stock mania has cooled and now Crypto fever has, too. So what’s a young Reddit retail trader to do with his cash? The answer, it would appear, is to park it in boring broad stock-market baskets. In what’s becoming the modern-day equivalent of stockpiling cash when at a loss for where to invest -- at least for the growing ranks of newbies who embrace a win-big-or-lose-big mentality -- demand for exchange-traded funds that track large indexes like the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is soaring. Over the past week alone, retail investors’ top bets pushed $434 million into State Street’s SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and $235 million into Invesco’s QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ), according to Vanda Research.

With the S&P 500 Index up more than 40% in the past year, leaving it hovering near a record, and the vaccine rollout allowing the re-oppening of offices, restaurants and bars, some individual investors appear to have decided to turn off their trading apps, put their money in a -- relatively speaking -- less risky space and enjoy the summer.
