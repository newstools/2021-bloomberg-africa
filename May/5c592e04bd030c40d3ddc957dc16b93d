U.S. futures edged up Monday and Asian stocks were set for a steady start as investors continue to weigh inflation risks and await key U.S. jobs data to gauge the strength of the economic recovery. Equity contracts were little changed in Japan, Australia and Hong Kong after U.S. stocks notched their fourth-straight monthly advance. Treasury yields ticked back below 1.60% on Friday.

The currency’s rapid appreciation against the U.S. dollar probably won’t last, according to a former Chinese central bank official, while the People’s Bank of China-backed Financial News said in an editorial Sunday that the yuan may depreciate in future. Bitcoin fluctuated around $36,000, following a Friday slump as Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda warned about the token’s volatility and speculative trading.
