Texas lawmakers are poised to pass several measures designed to help pay for the billions of dollars of energy costs stemming from catastrophic blackouts during the severe winter storm that hit the state this year. The Texas House of Representatives approved a bill on Tuesday that would allow electric co-operatives including bankrupt Brazos Electric Power Cooperative to cover unpaid power expenses from the disaster by selling debt that can be paid back over 30 years through charges on customer bills, a process known as securitization. The measure, which needs final Senate approval before heading to the Governor’s desk, would offer financial relief to electric co-ops that make up the bulk of the nearly $3 billion in payments owed to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the state’s main grid operator. Brazos filed for bankruptcy in March, citing about $2 billion in debts to Ercot. Separately, the Texas Senate is expected to soon vote on bills that would allow Ercot and gas utilities securitize their costs from the storm. The measures have already won approval in the Texas House. The moves come as Texas lawmakers race during the last week of their session to address the financial fallout of an Arctic freeze that crippled the state for nearly a week and left more than 100 dead. More than 4 million customers lost power for days after nearly half of the state’s power generation capacity failed during the storm. If the securitization measures gain final approval and are signed by Republican Governor Greg Abbott, customers’ energy bills would likely be saddled for years with charges to pay off the huge debts accumulated by utilities and suppliers who paid exorbitant rates for electricity and gas during the crisis.
