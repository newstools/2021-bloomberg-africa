Investors in South African assets need a lot more convincing that the government crackdown on corruption will prove effective. The rand strengthened as much as 1% against the dollar Thursday, the best gain among 15 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, government bond prices climbed and the benchmark stock index hit a one-week high after the ruling African National Congress suspended one of its most senior officials.

Sidelining ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule after he defied an ultimatum to vacate his post while he stands trial on graft charges is seen as a boost to the authority of President Cyril Ramaphosa. Magashule has repeatedly challenged the South African leader, who is attempting to implement policies to revive growth in the pandemic-ravaged economy. “This progress in the fight against corruption will be well received by investors,” said Michele Santangelo, a portfolio manager at Independent Securities in Johannesburg. “However, there is some way to go and there will certainly be pushback from those corrupt parties looking to protect themselves.” Ramaphosa Tightens Grip as Ruling Party Sidelines Main Rival Here are some views from analysts and money managers on what the ANC’s actions mean for markets: Natalie Rivett, emerging-markets analyst Graft Crackdown by South Africa’s ANC Boosts Election Prospects Santangelo, portfolio manager Warren Venketa, analyst Cassie Treurnicht, portfolio manager Lester Davids, investment strategist Stephen Meintjes, head of research — With assistance by Colleen Goko
