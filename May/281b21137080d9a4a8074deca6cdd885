Poland’s biggest provider of employee-perks programs said it expects to almost double its client base in the next five months on fresh demand for gym activities after lockdown. Benefit Systems SA, which offers “MultiSport” cards that give holders access to various gyms and swimming pools in Poland and other eastern European countries, reported a net loss of 48.9 million zloty ($13.3 million) in the first quarter as most sports facilities were closed due to virus restrictions. While the company sees headwinds through the second quarter, it said it has enough cash reserves to survive lockdowns since gyms and swimming pools are now reopened in Poland and the Czech Republic.

It’s now seeking to lure clients back with physiotherapy programs for people who suffered injuries as a result of the work-from-home environment.
