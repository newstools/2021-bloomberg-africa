France’s statistics agency cut its estimate of economic output at the start of the year, showing the euro area’s second largest economy slipped into a recession for the second time in the Covid pandemic. Gross domestic product declined 0.1% in the first quarter as construction was much weaker than early data had shown. Insee had initially reported growth of 0.4%.
